PyDy Visualizer
---------------

This document provides an overview of PyDy Visualizer. It enlists certain features
of the visualizer, and instructions to use the Visualizer.

PyDy Visualizer is a browser based GUI built to render the visualizations
generated by `pydy.viz`. It has many features to view and study the generated visualizations.

The visualizer can be embeded inside an IPython notebook. Inside the IPython notebooks, it also
provides additional functionality to modify the System parameters, from the GUI itself. The EoMs 
can be re-integrated using a click of a button from GUI, and can be viewed inside the same GUI in real time.


Here is a screenshot of the visualizer, when it is called from outside the notebook(from a terminal/interpreter):
